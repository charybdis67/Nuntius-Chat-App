To run the app, some installations needed:

For Laravel: composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"
For PHP: https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-php-on-windows/

After these and other needed installations, please run in terminal inside application folder. 

php artisan serve

For testing files, under Tests folder there are unit and example tests created. Also, in Laravel structure, inside Resources and Views, controllers are dealt with Handlers so there are code tests insides.
